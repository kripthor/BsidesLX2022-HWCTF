# ----BEGIN RULES FOR THE HARDWARE CHALLENGE---- 
## READ THESE RULES CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO FOLLOW ANY OF THE RULES WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE CTF DISQUALIFICATION!

- Leave all the hardware **EXACTLY** as you found it. We will check after each hack attempt.
- The electric fly swatter generates **HIGH VOLTAGE**, you absolutely **MUST** use gloves when handling it!
- **DO NOT** try to pry open or disassemble any hardware! It is dangerous and not needed at all to achieve your goal.
- Due to time constrains, a lot of information is provided. Read **all** the provided material before trying to hack it, otherwise there might not be enough time to do so.
- When in doubt, ask first!

A5. Ask for help.
